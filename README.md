simulate-recover


The simulate-and-recover exercise is designed to test how well the EZ diffusion model can recover its own parameters. This is a crucial step in validating the model's effectiveness and reliability. The process involves several key steps:

1. Selection of true parameters (v, a, T) and a sample size N.
2. Use of Equations 1, 2, and 3 to generate 'predicted' summary statistics (Rpred, Mpred, Vpred).
3. Application of Equations 7, 8, and 9 to simulate 'observed' summary statistics (Robs, Mobs, Vobs).
4. Utilization of Equations 4, 5, and 6 to compute 'estimated' parameters (vest, aest, Test).
5. Calculation of the estimation bias b = (v, a, T) - (vest, aest, Test) and squared error b^2.

The goal of this exercise is to determine if the model can accurately recover the true parameters that were used to generate the data. Ideally, the bias (b) should be close to 0 on average, and the squared error (b^2) should decrease as the sample size N increases. 

One important benchmark is that when (Robs, Mobs, Vobs) are set equal to (Rpred, Mpred, Vpred), the bias should be exactly 0. This represents a perfect scenario where the observed statistics match the predicted ones exactly.

The simulate-and-recover exercise allows researchers to make a simple but necessary claim: If data are truly generated by an EZ diffusion model, then the estimation procedure can recover the parameters accurately. While this might seem like a low bar, it's an essential validation step that not all models can clear.

The exercise involves simulating data using the forward equations of the model, then using the inverse equations to recover the parameters. This process mimics real-world scenarios where researchers have observed data and want to infer the underlying parameters of the decision-making process.

The sampling distributions for the observed statistics are crucial in this process. The number of correct responses follows a Binomial distribution, the observed mean reaction time follows a Normal distribution, and the observed variance of reaction times follows a Gamma distribution. These distributions introduce realistic variability into the simulated data.

By repeating this process many times with different true parameters and sample sizes, researchers can assess the model's performance under various conditions. They can examine how the bias and squared error change with sample size, which parameters are recovered more accurately, and under what conditions the model struggles.

The conclusions that can be drawn from this exercise are:

1. The EZ diffusion model's ability to recover its own parameters: If the model consistently recovers parameters with low bias and decreasing squared error as sample size increases, it demonstrates the model's internal consistency and reliability.

2. The impact of sample size on parameter recovery: By varying N, researchers can determine how large a sample is needed for reliable parameter estimation.

3. The model's robustness to noise: By introducing variability through the sampling distributions, the exercise tests how well the model performs under more realistic conditions.

4. Potential limitations or biases in the model: If certain parameters are consistently over- or under-estimated, it could reveal inherent biases in the model or its estimation procedure.

5. The model's applicability to real-world data: While this exercise doesn't directly test the model on empirical data, it provides a necessary foundation for trusting the model's results when applied to actual experimental data.

In summary, the simulate-and-recover exercise is a crucial validation step for the EZ diffusion model, demonstrating its ability to accurately recover parameters under ideal conditions and providing insights into its performance under various scenarios.
