simulate-recover

This simulate-recover exercise is designed to test the robustness of the EZ diffusion model in how well it recovers its own parameters. This followed several key steps:

1. Selection of true parameters (v, a, T) and a sample size N.
2. Use of Equations 1, 2, and 3 to generate 'predicted' summary statistics (Rpred, Mpred, Vpred).
3. Application of Equations 7, 8, and 9 to simulate 'observed' summary statistics (Robs, Mobs, Vobs).
4. Utilization of Equations 4, 5, and 6 to compute 'estimated' parameters (vest, aest, Test).
5. Calculation of the estimation bias b = (v, a, T) - (vest, aest, Test) and squared error b^2.

First, we select true parameters (V, a, T) which represent the drift rate, boundary separation, and non-decision time, as well as sample size N. These paramaters help describe the simulated data and help to test the model's performance. 

Then we used the forward equations (1, 2, and 3) to generate predecited summary statistics, Rpred, Mpred, and Vpred. These numbers reprseted the theoretical outcomes if the model perfectly described the data-generating process. The forward equations transform the abstract parameters into concrete, observable measures such as accuracy rates, mean reaction times, and variance of reaction times.

Next, we used sampling equations to simulate observed summary statisstics, Robs, Mobs, and Vobs.This brings in real world nouse and variablility into the data, and gives us the kind of data researchers would encounter in real studies.

Lastly, we appy the inverse equations to the estimated parameters with noise (Robs, Mobs, and Vobs). Now, we test the model's ability to recover the original parameters from noisy data, the feature that makes this most useful in cognitive modeling. 
Comparison of the estimated parameters to the true parameters allows researchers to calculate the estimation bias (b) and squared error (b²) and give insight on the model's accuracy and precision in parameter recovery. 

Some of the test we used in our model was making sure the bias (b) approached 0 after averaging over iterations as well as the squared error should decrease as the sample size N increases. Another important benchmark was seeing if Rpred, Mpred, Vpred gave Robs, Mobs, and Vobs, and vice versa. 

This exercise involved using the EZ diffusion model to recover parameters by mimicking real-world scenarios and input. In the real-world for example, researchers may have observed data and want to infer the underlying parameters of their decision-making process. 

Some of the conclusions that can be made from this exercise: It allows researchers to make a necessary claim: If data comes from an EZ diffusion model, then the estimation procedure can recover the parameters accurately. Additionally, this exercise serves as a validation of the EZ diffusion model’s ability to recover its parameters. 

This exercise also shows the impact of sample size on parameter recovery. With the variance of N, researchers are able to determine how large a sample is needed for reliable parameter estimation. Also, this model is very robust to noise, which is seen how the model performs under realistic conditions tested in this exercise. Furthermore, this exercise demonstrates that the EZ diffusion model can transform multidimensional data into low-dimensional parameter sets (this includes the parameters of drift rate, boundary separation, and non-decision time). 

In summary, the simulate and recover exercise was a necessary step for validating the EZ diffusion model because it demonstrates its ability to accurately recover parameters from data generated by the model itself, which is a fundamental requirement for its use in cognitive modeling.
